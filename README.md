# Evaluating the Performance of FancyImpute Methods in Diverse Data Scenarios
Welcome to the repository for my research paper, "Evaluating the Performance of FancyImpute Methods in Diverse Data Scenarios". This repository contains all relevant scripts and datasets utilized during the study.

## Data Sets
The data sets used in this study are sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php), a collection of databases, domain theories, and data generators widely used by the machine learning community for research.

## Imputation Library
The main focus of this research paper is evaluating the [FancyImpute Library](https://pypi.org/project/fancyimpute/), a powerful Python library that implements a variety of imputation techniques.

## Missingness Methods
The missingness methods implemented in this study have been adapted from this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/BorisMuzellec/MissingDataOT). The repository is linked to the following paper:

Muzellec B., Josse J., Boyer C., Cuturi, M.: [Missing Data Imputation using Optimal Transport](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03860)

This study conducts a comprehensive performance evaluation of six imputation methods across different data scenarios. Feel free to explore the code and replicate the experiments for your own research purposes.
